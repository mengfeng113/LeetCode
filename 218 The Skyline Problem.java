/* 218. The Skyline Problem
A city's skyline is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city 
when viewed from a distance. Now suppose you are given the locations and height of all the 
buildings as shown on a cityscape photo (Figure A), write a program to output the skyline 
formed by these buildings collectively

Notes:

The number of buildings in any input list is guaranteed to be in the range [0, 10000].
The input list is already sorted in ascending order by the left x position Li.
The output list must be sorted by the x position.
There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. 
For instance, [...[2 3], [4 5], [7 5], [11 5], [12 7]...] is not acceptable; 
the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: 
[...[2 3], [4 5], [12 7], ...]
