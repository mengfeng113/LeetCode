/* 317. Shortest Distance from All Buildings
You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings 
in the shortest amount of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. 
You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, where:

Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2):

1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
|   |   |   |   |
0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is minimal. So return 7.

    - beats 98% 9ms JAVA BFS 
    - basically use lee-algroithm, bfs each 1 to find out min distance to each 0, 
	accumulate this distances to each 0 location: distance[][], finally find out 
	min value from distance[][]
    - In the case of cannot find a house to each all house: 
        - not all 0s can reach each house: reachCount[][] to count the # of house 
		each 0 can reach, only >= houseCount valid
        - [~~improve speed~~]ï¼šnot all house can reach each house, in this case, w
		e cannot build such house, 
            -count reachable house #, if < houseCount, return -1 directly!!!!!
